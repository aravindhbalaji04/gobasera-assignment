## ðŸš€ Demo Flow Script

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
> "Welcome to the Society Registration System demo. This is a comprehensive solution for managing society registrations, payments, and support operations. Let me walk you through the key features and technical decisions."

### **1. Architecture Overview (1 minute)**

**Show**: Project structure and docker-compose.yml
**Say**: 
> "We've built this as a monorepo with a NestJS backend and React frontend. The backend uses Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, Redis for caching and job queues, and MinIO for S3-compatible file storage. Everything runs in Docker for easy development and deployment."

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Monorepo structure (`apps/backend`, `apps/frontend`)
- Docker Compose services (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO)
- Modern TypeScript stack

### **2. Authentication System (1 minute)**

**Show**: Firebase integration and JWT implementation
**Say**:
> "For authentication, we integrated Firebase Phone Authentication with a custom JWT system. Users can sign in with their phone number, and we generate secure JWT tokens for session management. We also implemented role-based access control with three user types: Support (super admin), Committee (society admin), and Owner (regular user)."

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Firebase Phone Auth integration
- JWT token generation and validation
- Role-based middleware and guards
- Development login bypass for testing

### **3. Society Registration Wizard (2 minutes)**

**Show**: Multi-step registration form
**Say**:
> "The core of our system is the multi-step registration wizard. Users start with society details, then add committee information, upload required documents, and complete payment processing. Each step auto-saves progress, and we use a funnel stage system to track where users are in the process."

**Demonstrate**:
1. **Step 1**: Society Details form
   - Name, address, city, state, pincode
   - Form validation and error handling
   
2. **Step 2**: Committee Details
   - Chairman, secretary, treasurer information
   - Phone number validation
   
3. **Step 3**: Document Upload
   - PAN, registration certificate, address proof
   - MinIO integration with presigned URLs
   - File type and size validation
   
4. **Step 4**: Payment Processing
   - Razorpay order creation
   - Payment status tracking
   - Webhook handling for payment confirmation
   
5. **Step 5**: Review & Submit
   - Summary of all entered information
   - Final submission and status update

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Progressive form with auto-save
- Document upload with S3-compatible storage
- Payment integration with webhook handling
- Funnel stage tracking

### **4. Support Dashboard (1 minute)**

**Show**: Support review interface and analytics
**Say**:
> "Support users have access to a comprehensive dashboard where they can review pending registrations, approve or reject applications with reasons, and view analytics on the registration funnel. Every action is logged in an audit trail for compliance and transparency."

**Demonstrate**:
1. **Registration Review**:
   - Table of pending registrations
   - Detailed view with all information
   - Approve/reject actions with reason input
   
2. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Funnel visualization showing conversion rates
   - Key metrics and statistics
   - Registration status distribution

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Comprehensive review workflow
- Analytics and reporting
- Audit logging system
- Role-based access control

### **5. Technical Implementation (1 minute)**

**Show**: API documentation, testing, and security features
**Say**:
> "On the technical side, we've implemented comprehensive API documentation with Swagger, a robust testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests with Playwright. We've also implemented security best practices including rate limiting, input validation, and webhook signature verification."

**Demonstrate**:
1. **API Documentation**:
   - Swagger UI at `/docs`
   - Interactive API testing
   - Request/response examples
   
2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Backend tests with Jest and Supertest
   - Frontend E2E tests with Playwright
   - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   
3. **Security Features**:
   - Helmet.js security headers
   - Rate limiting and CORS
   - Input validation with class-validator

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Testing coverage and automation
- Security best practices
- CI/CD pipeline

### **Closing (30 seconds)**

**Say**:
> "This Society Registration System demonstrates modern full-stack development practices with a focus on user experience, security, and maintainability. The system is production-ready with comprehensive testing, documentation, and deployment automation. Thank you for your time!"
